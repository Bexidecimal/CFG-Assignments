# CFG Assignments
_______
This repository is to complete assignments and practice skills for the CFG Software Engineering degree.

I have joined the CFG degree as I am looking for a career change, after completing a web dev kickstarter a few months ago I am hoping that coding is the right career path for me! 
I am currently an area manager in the railway, I oversee the running of 2 busy London stations. 

I have one other repository on Github which I have used to upload my project from the webdev kickstarter. I intend to use this repository to practice the principles taught in the degree
and create an even better project!

### Assignment One
For assignment one, I will be demonstrating my knowledge of git and github by completing the assignment set by CFG.

I have added explanations for what a .gitignore file and requirements.txt file are for. I have added these explanations 
within the files themselves as well as below. I have shown examples of markdown language. I have also added screenshots below to 
demonstrate my work

**Reason for gitignore file**

A gitignore file tells git which files it should ignore. This is useful for information that should not be shared beyond the local machine.
For example, anything with sensitive data that should not be shared on github and system specific files. This also allows
another level of security

**Reason for requirements.txt file**

A requirements file lists all the required packages that are needed to make a project work.
This can include dependencies and packages for example that must be installed, plus what versions are required.
Once you have a list of these requirements, you can use a command prompt to do the job for you with pip install.
Pip is a package manager for Python, it can install and uninstall Python packages.
This means that when you share your project with others, they can make sure they have everything they need to get going easily.
