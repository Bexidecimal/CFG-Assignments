# CFG Assignments
_______
This repository is to complete assignments and practice skills for the CFG Software Engineering degree.

I have joined the CFG degree as I am looking for a career change, after completing a web dev kickstarter a few months ago I am hoping that coding is the right career path for me! 
I am currently an area manager in the railway, I oversee the running of 2 busy London stations. 

I have one other repository on Github which I have used to upload my project from the webdev kickstarter. I intend to use this repository to practice the principles taught in the degree
and create an even better project! 

### Assignment One
For assignment one, I will be demonstrating my knowledge of git and github by completing the assignment set by CFG.

I have added explanations for what a .gitignore file and requirements.txt file are for. I have added these explanations 
within the files themselves. I have shown examples of markdown language. I have also added screenshots below to 
demonstrate my work
