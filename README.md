# CFG Assignment 1
_______
This repository is to complete assignments and practice skills for the CFG Software Engineering degree.

For assignment one, I will be demonstrating my knowledge of git and github by completing the assignment set by CFG.

I have joined the CFG degree as I am looking for a career change, after completing a web dev kickstarter a few months ago I am hoping that coding is the right career path for me! 
I am currently an area manager in the railway, I oversee the running of 2 busy London stations. 

I have one other repository on Github which I have used to upload my project from the webdev kickstarter. I intend to use this repository to practice the principles taught in the degree
and create an even better project!
