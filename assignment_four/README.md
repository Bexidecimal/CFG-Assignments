# Assignment 4 - <span style="color: orangered;">Happy Halloween</span>
_____
For assignment four we were tasked with creating our own API, connecting to our database, creating endpoints, a front end
and bringing together everything we have learned since the start of the course. 

I decided to help out a local monster hunting company <span style="color: green;">"U pay, we slay!"</span> 
(They need all the help they can get). I created a database to store all the monsters they know with some 
important details they might need in the field. I also created a front end to allow them to see all monsters listed or an individual monster. 
They are also able to add monsters and delete them. 

If you would like to test adding a monster, please see some examples below of ones they may have forgotten.

- Monster name: Ghost
- Country: Unknown
- Weakness: Ghostbusters
- Favourite food: Cake
- Identifying features: Transparent yet somehow green


- Monster name: Frankenstein's monster
- Country: Unknown (He likes to travel)
- Weakness: Fire
- Favourite food: Nuts and bolts
- Identifying features: Covered in stitches

If I had more time to do this I would probably change some of how I have completed this assignment. I 
would add more functions to the user interface but import them to main.py form somewhere else. The file started to get a little large. 
I would also add testing to make sure that all my functions are working correctly. 
___

### installation instructions
1. please use the 01_API_table_create.sql file to create the database and input all current information.


2. please input your user and password details to your own mysql workbench in config.py.


3. Please run the following code in the terminal, this will install all the required packages for the code to work smoothly.
I have included a requirements.txt file if you would like to review these.
